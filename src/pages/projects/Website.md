When I first got in Louisiana State University, I mostly had a "general" idea of what I wanted out of college:
- Become a engineer who made software to help folk. 

<em>Pretty normal stuff, all things considered.</em><br>
And I did, but I never got a good chance to practice good and practical web-dev.

So, as ritual for most (if not all lol) software engineers, I decided to make a portfolio website!
<br>
~~Which you're on. Good job so far!~~

I chose to keep it mostly simple at the current moment, and I went for a distinctly "human-made" theming.
<br>
Warm colors, avoiding gradient styling, and kept a paper-like style.
<br>
Both in light of revisiting my concepts of web-dev from college, while also not immediately vibecoding through all of it, in light of "relishing the difficulty of learning." 

Not exactly anti-AI but... check out [a recent post](../posts/aianditseffects.md) if you're interested in my take on AI.
<br>

And for portfolios and static sites in general, it's are quite simple, since it's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and/or Typescript 
<br>(I kept to the former since there wasn't much when I wrote it).<br>

But I chose to tack on a JS framework just in case: <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro!</a><br>
Three reasons why:

- Astro focuses on "HTML first, JS later" design, which I find with experience from React much simpler.
(that and <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/">a bunch of other concepts which I agree with</a>)
- Astro also provides "islands", which will help definitely later if I decide to add more complex stuff, like animations, visualizations, etc.
- As of recently, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/astro-joins-cloudflare/">Cloudflare</a> is supporting Astro directly and officially
  - So, potentially longterm support and general stability is insured. 
  - And y'know, having a giant internet provider support a web framework should mean a good nudge towards that "tribe" of framework users? 

There's a lot to love and dislike. I'm still working on it, and I'll update the page when it *is* past "MVP" stage.

But for now, it's definitely past a good minimal viable product.
Some things I like:
1. Styling's definitely a good one; I learned quite a lot of basic "what-not-to-do"s and "what-to-do"s <br>- ~~A lot more of the former than the latter.~~
2. I actually enjoy Astro!<br>-It's not as easy as it seems, but it's quite intuitive and most things have purpose to why they are.
3. Web dev is tough.<br>I see the influx on why web-developers find the need to "prove" themselves, cause it's  less "hackery" than what movies would lead you on to be.<br>But it's still code to write, and the required coding skills shift from math to designwork.


But a website is made, and idk how long I'll hold onto this.<br>
I've got a few things to tag on over time, and maybe I'll make a response,<br>
For now, keep on the watch, avid reader!<br>

I have a few references to list out for where I got inspiration, so check these folk out:
