  <h2>About Me</h2>    
  <div class="main">


      
      <p>
        When young me went to the doctor, my mom told me:
      </p>
      <p> 
        "You should learn to make and design stuff like those tools the doctor uses!"
      </p>
      
    <p>
      Well, nearly a decade and a half later and still interested in all things tech. AI, Robotics, anything.
      <br>
      I can comfortably say, hardware or software; give me some time and I can hold to that thought my momma had.
